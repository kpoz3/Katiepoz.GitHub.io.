Book: Knowledge-Oriented Applications in Data Mining



Author: Kimito Funatsu



Institution: University of Tokyo, Japan


This book involves different strategies that go more in depth of data mining and how to apply these strategies with data tools. In addition, how to solve problems when it comes to future reasearch. 

The reason I chose this book is because I want to expand my knowledge on how to solve problems. Data is very grand and there are numerous approaches to take on projects. That is why this book could give insights on how not to overlook data in certain aspects.
